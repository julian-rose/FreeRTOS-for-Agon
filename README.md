<h1>FreeRTOS/MOS for Agon Light</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
FreeRTOS port for the Zilog eZ80-based Agon Light (and compatibles) running MOS.
The concept is very much FreeRTOS over MOS, reflected in the project name.
FreeRTOS provides concurrency and time, and MOS provides the system services.
<p>

This Agon Light port integrates FreeRTOS version 20221201-LTS (10.5.1) with 
the Zilog ZDSII eZ80Acclaim! version 5.3.5 (Build 23020901) C language toolset. 
The choice of version 20221201-LTS prioritises stability over latest and 
greatest. For a detailed description of the Agon port, refer to the README in 
./FreeRTOSv202212.01-LTS/FreeRTOS/Source/portable/Community-Supported-Ports/ZDSII/eZ80AgonLight/

<h3>What is FreeRTOS?</h3>
FreeRTOS is a real-time software development kernel and library; an application 
development framework which allows a C language application to be arranged into 
a number of pre-emptive concurrent tasks. This follows the good engineering 
practice of simplicity through divide and conquer. The core of FreeRTOS (and 
indeed any RTOS) is its kernel; refer to https://www.freertos.org/RTOS.html. 
And to https://www.freertos.org/features.html for the API.
<p>

FreeRTOS is not an operating system in the sense of MOS or CP/M, which provide
a command console interpreter and long-term storage. Instead, FreeRTOS for Agon 
applications run on MOS to access its services. FreeRTOS, while a general
framework, is of particular interest for using Agon as a micro-controller.

<h4>Why do we care about concurrency and time?</h4>
In a nutshell, because they are in the real world. A micro-controller interacts 
with the real world, through sensors and actuators. So we need to embrace ideas 
of time and the order of events (concurrency) in our software, for it to 
function well. 

<h3>What is Agon?</h3>
Agon Lightâ„¢ is a fully open-source 8-bit microcomputer and microcontroller in 
one small, low-cost board. Refer to https://github.com/TheByteAttic/AgonLight.
It embeds two processor sub-systems: the eZ80-based main processor, which runs 
MOS (and where FreeRTOS programs will run); and the ESP32-based VDP terminal 
processor, which primarily performs I/O functions.

<h3>What is MOS?</h3>
MOS is the Machine Operating System for Agon Light and compatibles. It runs on 
the eZ80 and provides an API to access the eZ80 on-chip peripherals, on-board 
interfaces including the VDP terminal co-processor, and long-term file storage 
through SD-cards. Refer to https://agonconsole8.github.io/agon-docs/MOS/.
<p>

We have built against MOS version 1.4. All recent versions of MOS may work, 
but they have not been tested and there are a small number of tightly coupled 
dependencies in some parts of the code (such as the keyboard read functions) 
which may fail if differences exist between versions of the MOS code.

<h2>Project</h2>
FreeRTOS / MOS for Agon Light is a multi-versioned project. "Alpha" is the 
essential port of FreeRTOS as proof of concept running in eZ80 ADL mode. The 
alpha port supports all the FreeRTOS functions; and a minimal number of MOS 
services, namely putch (printf) and getch (scanf), and MOS function 14 
setIntVector needed to attach the tick ISR.
<p>

You can already use "alpha" to develop full FreeRTOS applications that will run 
on Agon. Though there are no library routine access to any of the MOS services.

<h3>Versions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>alpha:     provide all FreeRTOS with a minimal MOS in ADL mode</li>
  <li>beta:      provide a full library for the MOS functions</li>
  <li>gamma:     provide a full library for the VDP functions</li>
  <li>epsilon:   provide a real-time library inspired by posix-4</li>
  <li>omega:     a safer version with Z80-mode tasks and the ADL-mode kernel</li>
</ul>

"Beta" is currently being developed, with the sources located in 
./FreeRTOSv202212.01-LTS/FreeRTOS/Source/mos/

<h3>License</h3>
FreeRTOS / MOS for Agon is released under the MIT license. This is done mainly
for consistency with the existing MOS and core FreeRTOS software. 

<h3>Demos</h3>
The FreeRTOS / MOS for Agon port provides the source and binaries to two demo 
programs, which are found in ./FreeRTOSv202212.01-LTS/FreeRTOS/Demo/DemoAgonC/ 
and ./FreeRTOSv202212.01-LTS/FreeRTOS/Demo/DemoAgonP/. These are MOS application
programs, so that you can download the files .../DemoAgonC/Debug/DemoAgonC.bin 
and .../DemoAgonP/Debug/DemoAgonP.bin, copy them to your Agon Light SD card, 
load, and run them from the MOS prompt.
<p>

DemoAgonP uses pre-emptive multi-tasking. Two tasks run without knowledge of 
each other, each making MOS calls. The CPU (and MOS) is shared between them. 
Although they have no knowledge of each other, MOS in non-reentrant so that a 
second task will be blocked in making a MOS call until a first completes a MOS 
call. These example tasks also make time delay calls, such that task1 runs once 
per second, and task runs 3.3 times per second, to better demonstrate the
pre-emptive execution model.
<p>

DemoAgonC uses cooperative multi-tasking. Two tasks run without explicit 
knowledge of each other, but in the knowledge other tasks also need CPU time. 
Since they complete a MOS call before yielding, neither will be blocked by the 
other doing similar. 
These example tasks do not make time delay calls, to better demonstrate the 
speed of FreeRTOS / MOS on Agon.
<p>

Other demos may exist from time to time, to test new capabilities. Presently
this includes DemoMOS, for "beta" testing. 

<h3>Performance</h3>
Because one FreeRTOS task may block another, and because MOS is non-reentrant
(see below), FreeRTOS / MOS provides a "soft" real-time solution (rather than 
a "hard" one.) A "soft" solution is one in which the response time is not 
guaranteed, and may lag real time by a period (for now we might assume in the 
order of a milli-second, though some tests are needed to provide actual 
measurement data). 


<h2>Build</h2>
To build the demos, and to develop your own application programs, you will need 
to install the Zilog II eZ80Acclaim! toolkit on your PC-host development 
machine. In addition to the GUI, compiler, assembler and linker tools, this 
provides header and library files used by FreeRTOS for Agon.
<p>

The FreeRTOS port has been developed using using ZDS II - eZ80Acclaim! 5.3.5 
(Build 23020901) with Compiler Version 3.4 (19101101). Other recent versions 
of these tools should be okay; though the state of tool maintenance may result 
in errors different to those encountered and worked around.

<h3>hex2bin</h3>
The output from successful compilation will be a ".hex" file. This needs to be
converted to a ".bin" file for loading onto your Agon Light, which is done 
using a utility like hex2bin found at
https://sourceforge.net/projects/hex2bin/files/latest/download


<h2>Debugging</h2>
To catch those elusive resets (refer to UM007715 Illegal Instruction Traps)
in case of stack corruption or other bugs, I now possess a $100 ZUSBASC0200ZADG 
debug device from
https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/240/Littelfuse_ZUSBASC0200ZACG_Data_Sheet-3078266.pdf
At the moment it doesn't work on my (Windows 11) laptop :-(  ticket is with
Zilog.
<p>

To use the ZUSBASC0200ZADG Acclaim! smart cable hardware debugger, you will need 
version 5.3.5 of the ZDSII tools. Though, in general, you will not need the 
debugger to build applications, it may speed-up your development time if you do 
use it. FreeRTOS / MOS "alpha" was made running without a debugger, but it gave 
my brain a workout in doing so at times. 

<h3>Compiler Bugs</h3>
There are bugs in the ZDS tools. Rather than dismiss the compiler, I would like 
to see the Zilog tools rescued from their current maintenance contract and made 
Open Source. What is there is fundamentally useful - and would be better off in 
more careful hands.

<h3>Re-entrancy</h3>
I will point out, because you will run into it, that the Zilog libraries are
not re-entrant. C is not in itself a concurrent programming language. Neither
Zilog nor AgDev provide re-entrant libraries. This means that if two FreeRTOS
tasks interleave (make simultaneous) calls to library functions, your program 
may fail or lock up, or cause an Agon reset (through an illegal instruction in 
the case of stack or program counter corruption, or in case of math libraries 
through a divide by zero).
<p>

Your solution is to guard such calls to library functions by use of a semaphore 
or similar method available in FreeRTOS. 
<p>

To give an example, my first demo programs contained two tasks, each of which 
used a loop counter that was modulo tested (<it>if( 0 ==( ctr % 80 ))</it>...). 
Modulo <it>%</it> is implemented in Zilog using the math library. It took
several days until that 'doh' moment, to realise what was causing random
hardware resets. My solution was just to change the loop tests, but I could
have used semaphores around the <it>if</it> statement.
<p>

MOS itself is likewise non-rentrant. The port of FreeRTOS / MOS project takes 
care of this by guarding calls to MOS with a semaphore. This ensures two 
concurrent FreeRTOS tasks will not corrupt MOS or VDP calls. This comes at the 
cost of task-blocking - which means time passes un-usefully for the blocked 
task - but is the correct solution.


<h2>AgDev port</h2>
If you prefer to use the LLVM AgDev compiler instead of ZDS, you can Fork 
FreeRTOS/MOS for Agon and try it. This will create a new port (each port of 
FreeRTOS is the combination of target hardware / compiler). 
<p>

You will at the least need to provide the heap location in the linker directive 
file, or find another way to locate the heap memory; or, choose another heap
memory solution (there are five options in 
./FreeRTOSv202212.01-LTS/FreeRTOS/Source/portable/MemMang). 
<p>

A small number of Zilog header files are used with the ZDS port, such as ez80.h 
and eZ80F92.h. It should be possible to copy them over or replace them with
equivalent AgDev ones. Similarly, the Zilog specific libraries linked are for 
the C runtime, so that replacing them with AgDev ones should be doable.
